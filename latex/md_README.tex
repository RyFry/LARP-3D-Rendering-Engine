\subsubsection*{Dependencies}

Currently this project only runs on Unix systems. In order to build and run the project, the following dependencies are required\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 GLFW (Included with the project in the lib/ folder)
2 OpenGL
3 GLU
4 GLEW
5 pthread
6 Xrandr
7 Xxf86vm
8 Xi
9 Xinerama
10 X11
11 dl
12 Xcursor
\end{DoxyCode}
 All of these dependencies are what G\+L\+FW depend on, and most of them will be preincluded in a Unix install.

\subsubsection*{Building and Running}

To build and run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cd path/to/repository
2 make run
\end{DoxyCode}
 If all of the dependencies are met, the project should load and run.

\#\#\# Known Issues 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lglfw3
\end{DoxyCode}
 If you get this error, type the following commands from the root directory 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cd lib
2 ln -s libglfw.so.3.1 libglfw3.so
\end{DoxyCode}
 This will create a symbolic link to the proper G\+L\+FW library that your linker will be able to detect. This is already a known issue on Arch Linux.
